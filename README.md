# 🗂 Python Practice Projects — Main README

Welcome to my **Python Practice Repository** 👋  
This repository contains multiple **mini-projects** created to strengthen core Python concepts such as **logic building, file handling, functional programming, collections, and OOP**.

Each project has its **own README.md** with detailed explanations. This main README acts as a **guide** to all sub-projects.

## 📌 Repository Overview

This repo focuses on:
- 🧠 Logical thinking & problem solving
- 🧩 Core Python concepts
- 📂 File handling
- 🧮 Functional programming
- 🧑‍💻 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
