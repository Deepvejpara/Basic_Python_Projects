# 🧠 Logic Box — Pattern Generator & Number Analyzer

A beginner-friendly Python console program that combines **pattern generation** and **number analysis** to strengthen logical thinking and loop concepts.

This project is ideal for practicing:
- Nested loops
- Conditional statements
- User input handling
- Basic arithmetic operations

---

## ✨ Features
- Generate star (`*`) patterns using loops
- Analyze a range of numbers
- Identify **even and odd numbers**
- Calculate the **sum of numbers** in a given range
- Simple, menu-driven interface

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- **For loops & nested loops**
- **If–else conditions**
- **User input handling**
- **Basic arithmetic operations**
- **Menu-based program flow**

---

## ▶️ Program Menu
```
1. Generate a pattern
2. Analyze a Range of Numbers
3. Exit
```

---

## 📌 Functionality Explained

### ⭐ 1. Pattern Generator
- User inputs the number of rows
- Program prints a right-angled triangle star pattern

**Example output:**
```
*
* *
* * *
```

---

### 🔢 2. Number Analyzer
- User inputs a start and end value
- Program checks each number:
  - Prints whether it is **Even** or **Odd**
- Calculates the **sum** of all numbers in the range

**Example:**
```
Number 2 is Even
Number 3 is Odd
Sum of all Number from 2 to 5 is 14
```

---

### 🚪 3. Exit
- Safely terminates the program

---

## 🛠 How to Run
1. Ensure Python **3.x** is installed
2. Save the file as **Logic_Box.py**
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python Logic_Box.py
```

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add more pattern types
- Validate numeric input
- Add reverse or pyramid patterns
- Modularize logic into functions

---

## 📜 License
Free to use for learning and educational purposes.
